# *Code for:* Eco-evolutionary dynamics of temperate phages in periodic environments
*By Tapan Goel, 2024*

## General Description

This repository contains all the code need to replicate the figures and analysis show in the paper *Eco-evolutionary dynamics of temperate phages in periodic environments*. The code is written in MATLAB 2022b and MATLAB 2023b. Figure 1 was created in Inkscape 1.3.2 (091e20e, 2023-11-25, custom).

## Folder content description

### ./Data

Contains .mat files generated by running the scripts Figure4.m, Figure5.m and Figure6.m. 
- **"SteadyState_CyclePeriod=\<CyclePeriod\>,S0=\<InitialHostDensity\>,V0=\<InitialViralDensity\>,q_L=\<q_L\>,q_V=\<q_V\>.mat"**: contains steady state viral densities and number of cycles required to reach steady state for a range of integration probabilities and induction rates, given a growth cycle duration of *Cycle Period*, initial host density *S0*, initial viral density *V0*, lysogen passaging fraction *q_L* and virion passaging fraction *q_V*.

- **"SteadyState_CyclePeriod=\<CyclePeriod\>,S0=\<InitialHostDensity\>,V0=\<InitialViralDensity\>,q_L=\<q_L\>,q_V=\<q_V\>.mat"**: contains viral densities at invasion, matrix corresponding to the pairwise invasion plots and number of cycles required to ascertain invasion success or failure, given a growth cycle duration of *Cycle Period*, initial host density *S0*, initial viral density *V0*, lysogen passaging fraction *q_L* and virion passaging fraction *q_V*.

### ./Figures

- **OneStep_data.csv :** Metadata table containing information on one-step growth curves retrieved from the literature. Required to plot Figure 1. A version of this table is available as Table S1. 

- **OneStep_datasets/ :** Contains the individual datasets for the one-step growth curves retrieved from the literature. Required to plot Figure 1. First column of the file is time, second column is free-virus measurement. The units for each column are shown in the metadata file. 

- **Simulated OneSteps :** One-step growth curve simulations for multiple coefficient of variation (CV) values for the three datasets used in parameter inference (see main text Table 3). The first column corresponds to the simulated CV, the second column to the time of first visible burst. Required to plot Figure 6b. **Origin script: ./FigureScripts/GenerateOneStepTimesforFig6b.m**

- **host_CI_data1_6.mat :** Contains multiple total host simulations using the parameters inferred (see ParameterInference folder) for dataset: data1 and data ID: 6. Required to plot Figure 6a. **Origin plot: ./FigureScripts/GenerateCIforFig6a.m**

- **vir_CI_data1_6.mat :** Contains multiple free-virus simulations using the parameters inferred (see ParameterInference folder) for dataset: data1 and data ID: 6. Required to plot Figure 6a. **Origin plot: ./FigureScripts/GenerateCIforFig6a.m**

- **WangDennehy.csv: **  Lysis time population and cellular-level measurements recovered from Wang 2006, and Dennehy et al., 2011 respectively. See supplementary material Table S2.

- **Figure6b_inferenceAll.m :** The data required to plot this figure is obtained from the Parameter Inference framework. See the ParameterInference folder README for information on how the data was generated. 

- **FigureS1_EtoCV.m**

- **FigureS2_TurbidityvsOneStepErrorBars.m** 

- **FigureS3_insilicodata.m :** The data required to plot this figure is obtained from the Parameter Inference framework. See the ParameterInference folder README for information on how the data was generated. 

- **FigureS4_otherParams.m : ** The data required to plot this figure is obtained from the Parameter Inference framework. See the ParameterInference folder README for information on how the data was generated. 

- **FigureS5_diagnostic.m : ** The data required to plot this figure is obtained from the Parameter Inference framework. See the ParameterInference folder README for information on how the data was generated. 

### ./Figures
Figure storage. Output folder for figure producing scripts found in ./FigureScripts folder. 

### ./ParameterInference
The folder contains all code required to run a parameter inference framework that predicts host and viral-life history traits based on parameter fitting. The code is written in Julia v1.7.2 and contains its own README.
